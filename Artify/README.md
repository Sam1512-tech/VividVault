# Artify Web App

Welcome to Artify, a web application showcasing artistic images from various categories.

## Usage

1. Navigate through different art genres using the navigation links.

2. Click on an image to view details. You can mark an image as a favorite by clicking the heart button.

3. Visit the "Favorites" link to see and manage your saved artworks.

## Important Notes

- **Category-Specific Favorites**: Favorited images are specific to each art genre. If you mark an image as a favorite in one category, it won't be saved as a favorite in another category.

- **Favoriting Behavior Between Links**: The behavior of the favorite button is link-specific. Once you mark an image as a favorite in one link, the favorite button in the next link for the same image may appear inactive. However, if you mark a different image as a favorite in the next link, the button will work for that image. The interaction between favoriting in different links is independent.

- **Vice Versa**: After marking an image as a favorite in one link, you may find that the favorite button becomes active again in the previous link for that particular image. The favoriting status toggles vice versa between links.

This approach ensures a dynamic and category-dependent experience when managing your favorite images.

Feel free to explore, enjoy the art, and have a great experience with Artify!
